I started using an eisenhower grid to re-organise my to do list at work late 2021.

After realising the increased productivity gains more organising a to do list in a logical manner I decided that it would be a useful and fun project for myself.

## Features to add:

Multiple instances of Eisenhower Grid's - allowing for separated work/home/etc grids.
Individual instances & auth.

## Tech Choices:

- SvelteKit
- MongoDB
- Vercel

I originally started this project in React but found that I much prefer the low boilerplate Svelte for my personal projects and it was a good project to learn SvelteKit endpoints.

MongoDB was an easy choice for database as I had previously used it when going through some tutorials previously so already had an awareness of it and how to connect to it.

The SvelteKit Vercel adapter made for incredibly easy deployment to Vercel. It compiles all my endpoints to serverless functions and allows for continuous deployment from it's github repo.
